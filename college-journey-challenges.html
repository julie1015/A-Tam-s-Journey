        <h1>MICKEY</h1>
        <p>For me, starting college was a <b>roller coaster of feelings and transitions</b>.</p>
        <p>I initially had trouble <b>juggling my obligations and adjusting to the new setting</b>.</p>
        <p>The amount of work required for school was excessive. It was <b>difficult for me to make new friends</b> because I didn't know how to interact with people in such a strange environment.</p>
        <p>Another element of hardship was the <b>commute</b>. I frequently felt exhausted from lack of sleep and scheduling constraints.</p>
        <p>I overcame these obstacles by <b>learning to keep going get stronger</b>, and <b>adapt to the rigours of college life</b>.</p>

        <h1>ALLISON</h1>
        <p>During my college journey, I faced various challenges that tested my patience and adaptability.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest hurdles was <b>dealing with too many group projects</b>, which often required managing different personalities and schedules.</p> 
        <p><b>Commuting</b> daily was also exhausting, as traffic and long travel times drained my energy before and after classes.</p>
        <p><b>Academic pressure</b>, combined with <b>strict deadlines</b>, left me struggling to keep up with my studies and maintain good grades.</p>
        <p>On top of it all, the <b>lack of sleep</b> due to late-night studying and project deadlines made it even harder to stay focused and motivated.</p>

        <h1>BEA</h1>
        <p>Starting college was really challenging for me at first. I was <b>extremely shy and not used to commuting</b>, so adjusting to this new routine was overwhelming during my first week.</p>
        <p><b>Making friends was also nerve-wracking</b> because I didn’t know where to start, but I’m really thankful for the people who naturally came into my life.</p>
        <p>They’ve been a big support system for me, especially when I’m dealing with academic pressure or trying to learn new things.</p>
        <p>One of the hardest parts of college has been <b>managing all the deadlines</b>. It feels impossible to keep up, especially during midterms and finals, when exams and projects seem to pile up all at once.</p>
        <p>The <b>constant lack of sleep, limited time, and low energy</b> make it even more difficult to adjust to the demands of college life.</p>

        <h1>JULIE ANN</h1>
        <p>For me, being 3 hours away from college is the biggest challenge i had. It often <b>leads to feelings of homesickness and isolation</b>, making it tough to stay close to family.</p>
        <p>I do encounter stressfull things, like <b>tight schedule, and deadlines,</b> but it is tougher when you need to always consider the hours you'll spend on traveling.</p>
        <p>The <b>cost and time of travel can be draining</b>, especially when it impacts my studies and personal life.</p>
        <p>I also <b>miss out on family events</b> and sometimes struggle with not being able to go home easily during difficult times.</p>
        <p>Being far away makes it <b>harder to participate in campus activities</b> or seek immediate help when needed.</p>
